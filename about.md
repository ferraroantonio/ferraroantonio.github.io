  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Economics and Quantitative Methods at the <em>University of Genoa</em>. My research revolves around applied microeconomics and quantitative analysis, with a particular interest in public finance, macroeconomics, international economics, household finance, and demographic change. During the second year of my Ph.D. studies I was a Visiting Researcher at <em>Zhejiang International Studies University</em> in Hangzhou, China, where I developed projects on productive borrowing and on the role of single family offices in entrepreneurial finance.</p>

    <p>Before starting my doctoral journey, I worked as an analyst for consulting and technology firms in Dublin and Rome. The experiences gave me a practical, data-driven mindset that I bring to my academic work.</p>

    <p>I hold an M.Sc. in Economics and Political Science from the University of Milan, where I first became passionate about causal analysis and impact evaluation methods. I also earned a B.Sc. in International Sciences, Development and Cooperation from the University of Turin, which deepened my understanding of the socio-political and economic forces shaping today’s global society. During my undergraduate studies, I spent a semester at the <em>University of Hamburg</em> through the Erasmus+ Program, strengthening my German skills—a language that I’ve learned while living in Berlin and for which I hold a C1 TestDaF certificate.</p>

  <h2>Values and Interests</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>I am deeply passionate about global social and economic challenges, and I see research as a powerful tool to support decision-makers and improve outcomes for society. I have always aspired to make a positive contribution to the world, which is why the possibility to work on impactful, real-world problems strongly motivates me. As a result, I approach each task with persistence and care. Hard work, productivity, and perseverance represent a trademark of my character.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I am an inclusive and collaborative person who strives to bring out the best in others, listening carefully, and helping whenever I can. I believe in the value of cooperation and I consider myself a strong team player.</p>

    <p>Outside research, I enjoy staying active—I work out daily and jog on weekends. I also love spending time outdoors, whether hiking or exploring new places. Music and books are constant companions, helping me unwind and keep perspective beyond academic life.</p>
