  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Hi, I’m Antonio. I’m a third-year PhD candidate in Economics & Quantitative Methods at the <em>University of Genoa</em>. My research focuses on household finance and the distribution of wealth, with an emphasis on how inheritances of different asset types shape wealth accumulation over time. I work with Eurozone panel data (2010–2021) and apply microeconometric methods.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">My journey</h3>
    <p>I started out in international sciences at the University of Turin, spent an exchange year in Hamburg, and later completed an MSc in Economics and Political Science in Milan. Before starting the PhD, I worked in industry as an analyst and developer, which gave me a practical, data-driven mindset that I bring to my academic work. During 2024–2025, I was a Visiting Researcher at Zhejiang International Studies University in Hangzhou, which broadened my perspective on household finance topics in different institutional settings.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">What I’m working on now</h3>
    <p>My job market paper studies how the composition of inherited assets—real estate, businesses, financial assets—differentially affects household wealth dynamics. I’m also developing projects on productive borrowing and on the role of single family offices in entrepreneurial finance.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">Methods & tools</h3>
    <p>I enjoy careful data work and credible identification. Day to day, that means panel methods, fixed effects, and event-style designs, plus a fair amount of data cleaning and documentation. I work primarily in Stata and Python, and I’m comfortable moving between statistical code and presentation-ready outputs.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:14px;">Beyond research</h3>
    <p>I value clear communication and like turning complex results into something intuitive. Outside of work, I’m into long city walks, good coffee, and learning by building small tools and workflows.</p>
