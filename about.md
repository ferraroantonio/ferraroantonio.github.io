  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>I am in the final stage of my Ph.D. in Economics and Quantitative Methods at the <em>University of Genoa</em>. My research combines microeconometric tools with rich European panel data to study how households accumulate wealth and how inheritance affects wealth inequality. I spent the second year of my Ph.D. as a Visiting Researcher at <em>Zhejiang International Studies University</em> in Hangzhou, China, working under the supervision of Prof. Haoyong Zhou. There, I analyzed large and complex datasets on household finance and startup-level investment performance.</p>

    <p>Before starting my doctoral studies, I worked for consulting and technology firms in Dublin and Rome. At Infosys BPM in Dublin, I was an analyst responsible for English and German investment fund prospectuses, collaborating within a diverse, multiethnic team to manage sensitive financial data. At Accenture Technology in Rome, I contributed to data management and storage systems using <strong>Oracle</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Spark</strong>, and <strong>Hadoop</strong>, while also helping design internal applications with <strong>PyCharm</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong>, and <strong>Ubuntu</strong>.</p>

    <p>I hold an <strong>M.Sc. in Economics and Political Science</strong> from the University of Milan, where I first became passionate about econometric analysis through <strong>Stata</strong>. I also earned a <strong>B.Sc. in International Sciences, Development and Cooperation</strong> from the University of Turin, which deepened my understanding of the socio-political and economic forces shaping today’s global society. During my undergraduate studies, I spent a semester at the <em>University of Hamburg</em> through the Erasmus+ Program, strengthening my German skills—a language I’ve continued to study and for which I hold a <strong>C1 TestDaF certificate</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Economic research is, for me, a daily source of purpose and intellectual energy. From the very beginning of my academic path, I felt that research was the right environment to channel my curiosity and desire to contribute to society. I am driven by the idea that data-driven insights can meaningfully inform public debate and policymaking. I view each challenge as an opportunity to grow, and I see research as a continuous learning process—one that pushes you to question assumptions and expand your knowledge.</p>

    <p>I am motivated by projects with tangible social relevance, where rigorous analysis can help guide better outcomes for communities. My long-term goal is to contribute to policy-relevant research at the intersection of economics, inequality, and social welfare—areas where I believe careful quantitative work can make a genuine difference.</p>

  <h2>European and International Perspective</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>I am a genuine supporter of the European project and its founding values of cooperation, inclusion, and respect for diversity. My background in international studies and my experiences across several European countries have strengthened my belief in collaboration beyond borders. I see diversity as a powerful driver of creativity and innovation in research. Working in multicultural teams has taught me the value of listening carefully, asking questions, and striving to bring out the best in others.</p>
